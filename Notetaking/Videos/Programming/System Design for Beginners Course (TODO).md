Large Scale Distributed Systems - A product that is being used by a lot of people, frequently updated, and huge impact

Distributed Systems - The server and code is not in one place for performance gain

Design Pattern : A general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem

Ex: Publisher Subscriber Model 



## Live Streaming Model:

First: Define the requirements from the user's perspective
- Being able to see the video is a requirement

Second: Reduce the features into data definitions

Product Requirement -> Feature Abstract concepts -> Data definitions -> Objects -> Data base

Endpoints - Defined to be manipulated or queried (some sort of api)
- Send an electronic signal to the server which the server responds with a piece of data
- None of the services fail with an outage.

Fault Tolerance - If India server fails find a backup
Extensibility - Cost of change of existing codebase
Testing - Designs should be tested
