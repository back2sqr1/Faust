Affine Set: Contains the line through any two distinct points in the set

example: solution set of linear equations $\{x | Ax=b\}$

## Convex Set:
Line segment between $x_1, x_{2}$  

Convex sets contain line segments between any two points in the set
$$\theta x_{1} + (1 - \theta)x_{2} \in C$$

## Convex Combination and convex hull

Convex combination of $x_{1}, \cdots  x_{k}$ 

Where the sum of $\theta$ is 1

Convex hull : set of all convex combinations of points in S
## Convex cone
- A conic combination of $x_1, x_2$, 
$x = \theta_{1} x_{1} + \theta_{2} x_{2}$
$$\theta_{1} \geq 0$$
## Euclidean Ball:
A ball with a center $x_c$ and radius $r$
